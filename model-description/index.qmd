This document provides a high-level overview of the operation of the agent-based model under development for the Moving the Middle project. The model code is available for download at [this repository](https://github.com/DOSull/moving-the-middle-abm).

Although the model aims to be 'simple', that is a relative term. The model is only as complicated as it needs to be, which turns out to be relatively complicated. In short, there are a lot of moving parts. 

As a way to manage this complexity I have organised the description into a set of linked documents as listed below.
