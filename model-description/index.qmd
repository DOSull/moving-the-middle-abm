These documents provide an overall description of the operation of the agent-based model under development for the Moving the Middle project. The model is only as complicated as (we think) it needs to be, but that turns out to be relatively complicated, and there are a lot of moving parts. 

As a way to manage this complexity I have organised the description into a set of linked documents as listed below.

Included is a document with [possible extensions to the model](documents/06-possible-extensions.qmd) where I will add further anticipated changes arising from colleagues' suggestions for experiments that might be conducted using the model.

The model code is available for download at [this repository](https://github.com/DOSull/moving-the-middle-abm).
